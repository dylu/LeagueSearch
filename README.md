# LeagueSearch Readme

_LeagueSearch_ is a tool for [Rainmeter](http://rainmeter.net/).
It's intended for use as an overlay to search a summoner currently playing [League of Legends](http://leagueoflegends.com/)


### Installation

Make sure Rainmeter is installed on your computer.
Detailed instructions to do so may be found [here](http://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/installing-rainmeter)

--
There is currently no .rmskin package for this module, so you will need to copy this base folder over to your Rainmeter skins folder, and initialize the skin with the Rainmeter's own manage tool.


### Usage

This skin takes in a summoner's name of a summoner currently in-game.
It then displays the other players in their active game as well as their ranks and divisions, if any.

There are two 'versions' of this skin, LoLSearch and LoLDisplay -- LoLSearch consists of a smaller view that opens up to allow for an input summoner's name.  LoLDisplay takes this summoner's name and displays any relevant stats if the summoner is currently in a game.
